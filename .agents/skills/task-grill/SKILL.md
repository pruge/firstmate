# task-grill

This skill interrogates requirements before anything is designed or built.
It is the first stage of the planning flow: `task-grill`, then optional `task-design`, then `task-planning`.
It rewrites Matt Pocock's `grilling` and `domain-modeling` methods for Firstmate's operating model.
Their artifact formats stay behind.
This file owns the Firstmate-native contract.

## Trigger

Load when `task-planning` classifies a ship request as non-Simple at intake.
A Simple request skips straight to the direct crew path and never runs this skill.

## Design tree

Map the request as a design tree: decisions branching off decisions.
Each node names one decision that must settle before the questions hanging off it can even be asked.
Start from the goal, name the load-bearing branches, and grow children only where an answer would genuinely change what gets built.

## Rounds and the frontier

Work the tree in rounds.
The frontier is every question whose prerequisites are already settled: everything answerable now without guessing at unheard answers.
Each round asks the whole frontier at once, questions numbered, each with a recommended answer.
End the round there and hold for the captain's answers before the tree moves again.
Answers reshape the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock their dependents.
Recompute the frontier and ask the next round.
A question whose answer depends on a question still open in this round belongs to a later round, never this one.
Interrogation is done when the frontier is empty: every branch settled or explicitly discarded, nothing assumed in silence.

## Facts versus decisions

Facts are yours to find, never the captain's to supply.
When a frontier question needs repository evidence, read the target project clone directly.
Find one such fact before the first round: whether the target project keeps standing structural rules, usually numbered invariants.
Read the project's AGENTS.md and whatever source-of-truth document it points at for them.
If the project has none, record that and move on - the check ends there and adds no requirement to the flow.
If it has some, identify which ones the request would touch, by number.
When a frontier question needs broader investigation than a quick read, delegate one focused scout instead of asking.
Do not block the whole round on that investigation: only the questions downstream of it wait for the scout's report.
Only decisions go to the captain: preference, product policy, and trade-offs with genuine alternatives.
Never spend a round asking something you could look up yourself.

## Hard gate

While the frontier is not exhausted, or before the captain confirms shared understanding, spec, tickets, and implementation must not start.
This gate is not advisory: no downstream planning artifact may be written against unsettled decisions.
It was settled as captain decision D4 during this skill family's own planning.

## Captain answers stay human

Never answer a captain question on the captain's behalf.
A recommendation is not consent, and silence is not an answer.
Route every unresolved captain question through `captain-hold-lifecycle`, which owns the decision-hold contract.

## Artifacts

Write `docs/features/<feature-slug>/grill.md` in the target project clone, beside the other planning documents.
Keep three things in it:
- a snapshot of the design tree;
- the round log;
- the settled decisions, including which standing project rules the confirmed understanding touches, so the specification stage inherits that check instead of repeating it.

Record terminology cleanups surfaced during grilling there as well.
Promote them into the project AGENTS.md `Domain terms` section at landing time through that project's normal delivery path.

## Domain modeling discipline

Grill the domain model while you grill the requirements.
Challenge glossary conflicts immediately: when fresh language contradicts recorded terms, surface the conflict now instead of shipping both meanings.
Sharpen fuzzy terms: propose a precise canonical name whenever wording is vague or overloaded.
Stress-test relationships with concrete scenarios that probe edge cases and force exact boundaries between concepts.
Cross-check stated behavior against the code and surface contradictions.
Offer an ADR only when all three hold:
- the choice is hard to reverse;
- it is surprising without context;
- it was a real trade-off with genuine alternatives.

If any is missing, skip the ADR.

## Handoff

When the gate passes, hand the confirmed understanding down the family: optional `task-design` for solution shaping, then `task-planning` for specification and ticket decomposition.
This skill ends at confirmed requirements and never writes the spec itself.
