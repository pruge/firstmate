#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-worktree-bootstrap.sh - fill a task worktree's untracked dev environment
# from this firstmate home's own clone of the same project.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   `git worktree add` checks out TRACKED files only. Untracked dev material -
#   local secrets (.dev.vars, .env) and local database state (.wrangler's
#   miniflare D1) - never comes along, so the app either will not start or
#   starts against whatever stale state a reused pool worktree still holds.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Copies the project's declared untracked dev paths from the home's own
#   clone of that project into the task worktree, always overwriting file by
#   file, and never writes anything back to the source clone. The source is
#   $FM_HOME/projects/<worktree-name> - the same single source of project
#   material bin/fm-spawn.sh provisions from (bin/fm-worktree-runtime-lib.sh)
#   - so a project with no clone in this home is a silent no-op rather than a
#     new configuration surface.
#
# WHAT TO COPY
#   The repository's own `.worktreeinclude`, one repo-relative path per line,
#   `#` comments allowed. Absent = this project declares no dev material, so
#   the tool is a silent no-op. The project declares its needs; firstmate
#   decides where they come from. Neither side hardcodes the other.
#
# CONTRACT
#   Copies what exists; skips what does not silently; warns on copy failure
#   without failing the task (best-effort, like every provisioning copy step);
#   refuses an unsafe declaration path loudly. There is deliberately NO
#   deletion path: copies overwrite destination files in place, stale extra
#   files are left for teardown to discard with the whole worktree, so nothing
#   here can destroy material the worker or a previous occupant created.
#
# USAGE
#   bin/fm-worktree-bootstrap.sh                 run from inside the worktree
#   bin/fm-worktree-bootstrap.sh <worktree-dir>  or name it explicitly
#
#   FM_HOME resolves exactly like every other firstmate script: an explicit
#   FM_HOME wins, else FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE, else this checkout's root.
#
# EXIT
#   0 on success and on every no-op and best-effort warning (missing config,
#   missing declaration, missing source project, individual copy failures).
#   A worker running this in an unrelated repository must not be blocked by it.
#   Non-zero only for malformed input it refuses to act on: a bad directory
#   argument, a path outside git, or an unsafe path inside .worktreeinclude.
